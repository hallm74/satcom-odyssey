# What Comprehensive IT Management Really Means

Most businesses only think about IT when something breaks — but downtime, data loss, and security breaches don’t wait until it’s convenient. That’s where comprehensive IT management comes in. It’s not just about fixing problems. It’s about making sure your systems *work right* in the first place.

At SatCom & Computers, we provide complete IT management designed for local businesses and public agencies in Louisiana and East Texas. That means fewer headaches, faster support, and the peace of mind that your tech is covered.

## What Is Comprehensive IT Management?

Here’s what’s actually included when we manage your IT:

### 🖥️ System Monitoring & Maintenance

We keep a constant eye on your computers and servers — applying updates, catching issues before they cause trouble, and ensuring everything runs smoothly in the background.

### 🔒 Security & Threat Protection

From antivirus to ransomware defense, we deploy multi-layered protection that blocks threats before they reach your network. We also monitor for suspicious behavior and respond immediately.

### 🌐 Network Management

We manage your internet, Wi-Fi, switches, firewalls, and VPN connections — whether you're in one building or spread across multiple locations. No more calling five vendors when something goes down.

### 👩‍💻 Helpdesk & End-User Support

Staff having issues with printers, software, or login credentials? We handle all of it. Fast support from people you know, not an overseas call center.

### 📦 Vendor & Licensing Management

We keep track of your software licenses, warranties, and vendor relationships. You’ll never have to guess when it’s time to renew or update again.

### 💾 Backups & Disaster Recovery

Accidents happen. We make sure your data is backed up securely — and can be restored quickly in case of hardware failure, natural disaster, or a cyberattack.

## What Makes SatCom’s Approach Different

At SatCom, we don’t just offer generic IT support. We understand the **real-world needs of local governments** and **small businesses** because we work with them every day.

We’re already familiar with the policies and paperwork that come with public agency IT, and we help ensure your systems meet:

- ✅ **CJIS** (Criminal Justice Information Services) compliance for handling law enforcement data  
- ✅ **HIPAA** compliance for protecting personal health information  
- ✅ **PCI-DSS** standards for secure payment processing  
- ✅ General **access control**, **audit trails**, and **information security policies** required for state contracts and vendor vetting

## Do You Need IT Management?

If any of these sound familiar, it’s probably time:

- Your staff regularly loses time due to tech issues  
- You’re not sure if your backups are working  
- You’ve had virus or email issues in the past  
- You need to meet compliance standards (CJIS, HIPAA, etc.)  
- You don’t have anyone checking if updates or patches are actually applied  
- You want a local partner who will *own the issue* until it’s resolved
