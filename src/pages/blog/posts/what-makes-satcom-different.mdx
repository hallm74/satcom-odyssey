## What Makes SatCom Different

When I started SatCom in 1998, the goal wasn’t just to fix computers — it was to give local businesses and public agencies someone they could call who actually understood what they needed.

That mindset hasn’t changed.

Today, SatCom & Computers is still local, still personal, and still focused on what matters most: being the team our clients can count on.

### We become part of your team.  
At SatCom, we don’t just maintain your systems — we learn your workflows, your software, and your day-to-day needs. We’re willing to dive into the tools you rely on, even if they’re unique to your industry. If your team uses it, we’ll figure it out and support it.

Whether that’s case management software at a sheriff’s office, QuickBooks for a small business, permit systems at town hall, or an automation system for a local radio station — we support more than just the machines. We support the way you work.

### We’re local — and we show up.  
We live here. We work here. When you need help, we’re not a support ticket in a big queue — we’re a name and a face you already know. If something breaks or goes sideways, we’ll be there — sometimes before you even ask.

### We don’t just fix problems — we prevent them.  
We believe in being proactive. That means monitoring, patching, updating, and helping you plan ahead so you’re not blindsided later. We design systems that scale with you and make sure your tech doesn’t become a roadblock to growth.

### Security isn’t optional — it’s built in.  
A big part of what we do is keep our clients compliant and protected. Whether it’s CJIS, HIPAA, or PCI-DSS, we’ve got the right tools in place — and we document every piece of it. You won’t have to guess where your security stands.

### You’re not just another client.  
We only work with people we can build a real relationship with. That means you know who you’re talking to, and we take the time to truly understand your environment. We care about doing things right — not just getting them done.
